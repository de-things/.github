## A gist...
...is to make each smart home device decentralized and self-contained without a need to communicate with it using world-wide China-like server (Hi Aqara, Tuya and etc. etc.). So you basically build your own things using these tools!

Yes, we have alternatives for decentralized smart home, like a **[Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/)**, but it's too complicated for me, as I wanted to handle an IoT environment with my own knowledge, so I did this thing... a *de:thing*, basically, ha-ha.

## Core
**[delib](https://github.com/de-things/delib)** - is the core lib for the whole stuff here. You include it into your Arduino controllers and build them as web servers with request handlers. You can use as WiFi as Ethernet interfaces to send data to and fro.

Yes, you need your custom frontend as well as firmware for each device to make your own smart home, **[delib](https://github.com/de-things/delib)** is just a tool to help you with this.

I have few examples of how things work, so you can dive into it, observing this organization page.

*P.S. Some reference links in russian, so if you can't read it, ehh... Good luck!~*
